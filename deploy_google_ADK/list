[m[1mDESCRIPTION[m
    The [1mgcloud auth[m command group lets you grant and revoke authorization to
    Google Cloud CLI ([1mgcloud[m CLI) to access Google Cloud. Typically, when
    scripting Google Cloud CLI tools for use on multiple machines, using [1mgcloud
    auth activate-service-account[m is recommended.

    For information about authorization and credential types, see Authorizing
    the gcloud CLI (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing). For
    information about authorizing a service account, see Authorizing with a
    service account
    (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/authorizing#service-account).

    After running [1mgcloud auth[m commands, you can run other commands with
    [1m--account[m=[1m[1;4mACCOUNT[1m[m to authenticate the command with the credentials of the
    specified account. For information about [1m--account[m and other [1mgcloud[m CLI
    global flags, see the gcloud CLI overview
    (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference).

    See [1m$ gcloud topic client-certificate[m to learn how to use Mutual TLS when
    using gcloud. Mutual TLS can be used for certificate based access
    (https://cloud.google.com/beyondcorp-enterprise/docs/securing-resources-with-certificate-based-access)
    with gcloud.

[m[1mEXAMPLES[m
    To authenticate a user account with [1mgcloud[m and minimal user output, run:

        $ gcloud auth login --brief

    To list all credentialed accounts and identify the current active account,
    run:
